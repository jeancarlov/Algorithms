# Hash functions through hash table method

## Hash function role is to take data of arbitraty size and convert the data into a fix size. In other words. it is going to receive a large input and sent a fixed size

## Hash Function convert keys into valid array indices

## Prime numbers in the hash is helpful in spreading out the keys more uniformly. It also helps if the array that you are putting values into has a prime length

## What makes a good Hash?
### 1. It needs to be fast. 2. Doesnt cluster outputs at specific index, but distributes uniformaly.  3. Deterministic that it provides the desire output.

### Computers dont know how to find an element at index pink.  Hash tables are a bridge between human readability and computer readability. Note: Some computer programms ex: Python already have a built in functions. This model is to understand the behind the scenes

### To implement a hash table this model wull be using an array. 


### Hash functions have plenty of implications in security and cryptography in the real world

### Even with a a great hash function collisions are inevitable. However, there are many solution when dealing with collisions ex: Separate chaining, and linear probing
