##How recursive functions work 

# Invoke the same function with a different input until you reach your base 
###  Base Case is where the recursion ends !important!


# Second recursive function 

# Ask your Self this questions 

## Can you spot the base?
## Do you notice the different input?
## what would happen if we didn't return?
