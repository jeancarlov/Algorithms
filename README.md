##How recursive functions work 

# Invoke the same function with a different input until you reach your base 
###  Base Case is where the recursion ends !important!


# Second recursive function 

# Ask your Self this questions 

## Can you spot the base?
## Do you notice the different input?
## what would happen if we didn't return?

# Common recursion pitfalls

## no having a base case or case base is wrong 
## Forgeting to return  or returning the wrong thing 

### If the return 1 is taking off then the function will go never ending the return is the break

# Helper method recusion

## Helper method recursion has two functions one in and one out
