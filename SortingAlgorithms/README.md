### What is sorting?
# Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection(array) so the items are in some kind of order
# Example: Sorting numbers from smallest to largest, names alphabetically , movies based on release year.

### What is the time complexity of bubble sort? usually is O(n^2) but if is netly sorted then with no swaps O(n) like linear. This could be the best scenerio unless if the data if nearly order but dont rely on it.


## Selection Sort
# Selection sort is similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small value into sorted position. 
# Actually the sorted data starts at the beginning  rater than end
#  When to do Selection? to reduce the amount of swaping

## Insertion Sort 
# Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left sorted portion
